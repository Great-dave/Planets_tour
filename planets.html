      <h3>
        Mercury
      </h3>
      <p> <img src="https://theplanets.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/mercury-300x300.png"
          alt="image of Mercury Planet">
      </p>
      <p> <strong>Mercury</strong> is the smallest planet in the
        solar system, approximately 3000 miles (4850 km) in diameter, hardly larger than the moon. Despite being the
        smallest,
        it’s extremely dense. In fact, it’s the second densest planet after Earth. It’s also the closest planet to the
        sun,
        making it dangerous to explore. Mercury is 48 million miles from the earth.
        <p>
          Since it’s the nearest planet to the sun, surface temperatures can go up to a scorching 800 degrees Fahrenheit
          to
          a
          freezing -300 degrees below zero. Mercury orbits the sun every 88 days, faster than any planet, by far. It’s
          characterized by short year. Despite its short year, a single day on Mercury is equivalent to about 59 Earth
          days.
          Mercury is thought to be more than two-thirds metallic and a third silicon or rock. </p>

      <h3>
        Venus
      </h3>
      <p> <img src="https://theplanets.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/venus-300x300.png" alt="image of Planet Venus">
      </p>
      <p> <strong>Venus</strong> is the second planet from the sun, and close to the earth, which is why it’s often
        referred to as our
        sister
        planet. It’s similar size to the Earth, about 7300 miles (12,000 kilometers). It’s nicknamed ‘’the morning
        star,”
        and
        thought to be the most inhabitable planet. Surface temperatures of Venus approach 900 degrees Fahrenheit, hot
        enough
        to melt the surface of the earth. Venus has a characteristic thick atmosphere, composed mainly of sulphuric acid
        and
        carbon dioxide. </p>
      <p>
        Humans could not breathe in Venus since the atmosphere would be severely toxic. In fact, Venus’ atmosphere has
        more
        acid per cubic centimeters than a car battery. This atmosphere is the reason why Venus appears brownish-yellow.
        Venus
        rotates relatively slowly. It takes 243 days to make a complete turn. Mercury and Venus are the only planets
        that
        do
        not have moons.. </p>

      <h3>
        Earth
      </h3>
      <p> <img src=" https://theplanets.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/earth-300x300.png" alt="image of Planet Earth">
      </p>
      <p> <strong>Earth</strong> is a unique plant in the entire solar system because it teems with life, including
        millions of aquatic
        and
        terrestrial animal and plant species. It has active plate movement and humans also live on this planet. Earth’s
        core
        is almost entirely composed of iron. The inner core is solid, while the outer core is liquid.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next layer is called the mantle and is made up of rock, mostly viscous or semi-liquid state. The surface is
        formed
        of a thin rocky crust. Earth is the 5th largest planet in the solar system (12,000 kilometers in diameter) and
        is
        thought to be 4.6 billion years old. The earth revolves around its axis every 24 hours and orbits the sun every
        365
        days (a year). The earth consists of one moon. </p>
    </div>

    <div id="planets">
      <h3>
        Mars
      </h3>
      <p> <img src=" https://theplanets.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/mars-300x300.jpg" alt="image of Planet Mars">
      </p>
      <p>It often called the red planet and nicknamed Roman god of war. Mars is a little bigger than the earth (about
        6,790
        kilometers in diameter). It has almost similar characteristics to earth such as mountain ranges, rolling plains,
        gigantic canyons, and volcanoes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mars</strong> takes 687 days to orbit once around the sun, and its rotation speed is equal to the
        earth’s (24.6hrs). The
        surface is mostly covered by iron-rich volcanic rock. The rock is sprinkled with iron oxide, which gives the
        planet
        its characteristic red tint. Mars has a relatively thin atmosphere, and consists of two small moons. </p>

      <h3>
        Jupiter
      </h3>
      <p> <img src=" https://theplanets.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/jupiter-300x300.png"
          alt="image of Planet Jupiter">
      </p>
      <p> <strong>Jupiter</strong> is the largest of all the planets in the solar systems (142,980 kilometers in
        diameter) and more than
        11
        times wider than Planet Earth. Jupiter rotates around the sun once each 12 years. Despite its sheer size,
        Jupiter
        rotates on its axis pretty fast (in 9hrs and 19 min). Jupiter is made up of gas and liquid, and has no solid.
        It’s
        90%
        hydrogen and 10% helium, as well as traces of methane, water, and ammonia. This means that if you were to land
        on
        the
        surface, you would sink into it.</p>
      <p>
        Theoretical evidence stipulates that Jupiter‘s core is made up of metallic hydrogen and rock. The exterior
        gaseous
        part is split into bands of brown, red, yellow and white clouds. Jupiter consists of four rings mainly made up
        of
        dust. The surface also experiences oval-shaped storms. As of 2016, Jupiter encompasses 67 known satellites, plus
        the
        4
        large Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Callisto, and Ganymede), as wells as numerous small ones, which remain
        unnamed.

      <h3>
        Saturn
      </h3>
      <p> <img src="https://theplanets.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/saturn-300x300.png" alt="image of Planet Saturn">
      </p>
      <p> <strong>Saturn</strong> is the 6th planet away from the sun. It’s one of the largest and brightest planets,
        nine times the size
        of
        the earth (120,536 kilometers), and orbited by numerous objects. Saturn is recognizable by its system of three
        rings.
        It orbits the sun in 12 years and rotates slightly more than 10 hours. Saturn has a relatively small and solid
        dense
        core, composed mainly of ice and rock. It’s surrounded by a layer of liquid metallic hydrogen. The exterior
        layer
        is
        composed of helium, molecular hydrogen and traces of water, methane, and ammonia.</p>
      <p>
        As opposed to other planets, Saturn has no definable surface. As an alternative, there is a slow transition from
        a
        gaseous atmosphere to liquid interiors. Its core is extremely hot (21, 00 degrees Fahrenheit). In fact, Saturn
        is
        thought to radiate 2.5 times more energy than it receives from the sun. Its surface appears branded, and
        consists
        of
        a
        brown-yellow, butterscotch color. Saturn consists of 62 moons as of 2016 statistics. It’s nicknamed the Roman
        god
        of
        agriculture.</p>

      <h3>
        <strong>Uranus</strong>
      </h3>
      <p> <img src="https://theplanets.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/uranus-300x300.jpg" alt="image of Planet Uranus">
      </p>
      <p>Uranus is the 7th planet from the sun. It’s the third-largest planet in the solar system, 4.4 times the size of
        planet earth (51,118 kilometers). Uranus orbits the sun relatively slowly. It takes 84 years to complete a
        single
        orbit, rotating on its axis much faster than the earth (17 hours). Uranus can be seen with the naked eye and has
        a
        characteristic blue color. Like Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus has no solid outer surface, which means the entire
        surface
        is made up of gases, with a fairly uniform blue-green color.</p>
      <p>

        However, the core is solid and rocky, and since it’s too far from the sun, the core is surrounded by a mantle of
        ice,
        which is why this planet is referred to as an ice triad. As of 2016, Uranus has 27 moons and is wrapped around
        by
        a
        system of nine rings. Uranium is nicknamed “grandfather of Jupiter.” </p>

          alt="Image of Planet Neptune">
      </p>
      <p> <strong>Neptune</strong> is a little smaller than Uranus, and 17 times bigger than earth. It has a measurement
        of 49, 500
        kilometers
        in diameter. Neptune is the 8th and furthest planet from the sun. It orbits the sun once each 165 years. It has
        almost
        similar structure and composition as Neptune, as its outer surface appears blue, and characterized by large dark
        blue
        storm systems. A system of five rings surrounds Neptune and consists of 14 moons. It’s nicknamed the Roman god
        of
        the
        ocean. </p>

      <p> <img src="https://theplanets.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pluto-300x300.png" alt="image of Planet Pluto">
      </p>
      <p> <strong>Pluto</strong> is found 3.7 billion miles from the sun. It’s half the size of the earth’s moon, which
        is why it was
        renamed
        dwarf planet. Pluto is composed of chiefly rock and ice. The surface is made up of almost completely frozen
        methane,
        nitrogen, and carbon monoxide. It orbits the sun in 28 years and rotates in a duration of 6.4 days. It’s
        composed
        of
        one large moon and nicknamed the Roman god of outer darkness. </p>
