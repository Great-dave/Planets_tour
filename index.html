      What are Planets of the Solar System </h2>
      <p>
        Almost all of us have looked up into the sky and wondered what is there. Well, there are lots of fascinating
        objects
        revolving out of space. Humans have left the earth in space ships to explore the solar system that surrounds it.
        It’s
        known as the solar system since everything in it revolves around the Sun and solar means the Sun.

        Eight known planets, the moon, as well as comets, asteroids and other space objects, revolve around the sun. The
        Sun
        is the largest object in the solar system. In fact, it accounts for 99% of the solar systems’ mass. Astronomers
        estimate that the solar system is more than 4.5 billion years old.
